# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Structure

This is a development workspace organized into purpose-specific directories:

- `projects/` - Main development projects
- `experiments/` - Experimental code and proof-of-concepts  
- `learning/` - Educational projects and tutorials
- `archive/` - Completed or old projects
- `claude-sessions/` - Claude Code session data

## Development Approach

When creating new projects:
1. Place them in the appropriate directory based on their purpose
2. Follow standard conventions for the chosen language/framework
3. Include necessary build/development files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)

## Configuration

- `.claude/settings.local.json` tracks bash command permissions
- No global build tools or package managers are currently configured
- Environment is language-agnostic and ready for any development stack

## Current State

This is a fresh workspace with no active projects. When working here:
- Determine the appropriate directory for new work
- Set up language-specific tooling as needed
- Follow project-specific conventions as they're established
